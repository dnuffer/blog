My current goal is to get a fast neural style network built and trained using TensorFlow to run on iOS.

In order to save a tf model after (and during) training, the tf.train.Saver class can be used. The file that this saves isn't usable as-is, and a few other steps need to be done:

1. strip_unused
2. freeze_graph
3. optimize_for_inference
